  this page is devoted to the various rumblings and reverberations that
  <dfn>$ echo</dfn> through the damp chasms of my skull

    <em>1636961033</em> cairo: a poor man's processing. i'm enjoying the
    directness of <i>'straight-to-png'</i> coding. i am also enjoying not having
    to use java or a blasted web browser (yes, i'm talking about <i>you</i>).

    <em>1630878941</em> creating a layer of abstraction between your program and
    the hardware it influences allows for immortality and portability. it also
    forces you to consider what you really <i>need</i> from the hardware in
    question. <em>currently</em>: want to figure out what basic drawing
    utilities i need to make graphical programs, i'm thinking sprites/textures,
    shapes, input, read/write files and some 'window' operations like resizing.

    <em>1630842884</em> faffed around with some dotfiles and bash scripts to
    randomly change the color scheme every <dfn>startx</dfn>. had some problems
    with exporting variables (because <i>apparently</i> you cant export global
    system variables from any old script); ended up setting them from my
    <dfn>.xinitrc</dfn> file. then had further problems splitting up the
    multi-line output from my <dfn>randcolor</dfn> script. resolved by using
    arrays (<i>you can have arrays in bash?!?</i>). bash always surprises me
    with its depth, although it does have a rather unforgiving learning curve.
    fortunately, <dfn>berryc</dfn>, <dfn>polybar</dfn> and
    <dfn>xsetroot</dfn> all use environmental variables so didn't have to wiggle
    their configs much (sidenote: <dfn>xsetroot</dfn> works well for setting the
    background to a solid color!). <dfn>kitty</dfn> however required a
    surprisingly small amount of wiggle. the solution i came up with was to
    write my random colors (<i>fg</i>, <i>bg</i>, and <i>accent</i>) to
    <dfn>~/.config/kitty/colors.conf</dfn>, and add
    <dfn>include colors.conf</dfn> to <dfn>~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf</dfn>.
    this approach is very extensible, so i could randomize any number of kitty
    settings if i so wished (which i currently do not). pretty happy with the
    result now
