  here lies a collection of art and code and code-art projects of my own
  creation

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/hatcatpat/compakt">compakt</a>: This project is
    an audio and gui library for quick prototyping of audio applications,
    written entirely in C using SDL, Jack, and FFTW. I wanted to build a tool
    that would allow me to create my own “instruments”, consisting of various
    audio effects and controls. I implemented all of the audio algorithms from
    scratch, including an FFT based pitch shifter, frequency scope, comb/delay
    lines, and biquad filters

  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/hatcatpat/jisp">jisp</a>: a Lisp-to-Javascript
    transpiler, written entirely in Javascript. It uses a homemade variant of
    Lisp, which includes: let bindings, macros, lambda functions, and globals.
    Additionally, it has full Javascript interop (essential for this kind of
    task). It is also very small, with around 300 sloc, and fast enough to be
    used as a REPL

  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/hatcatpat/Oscvst">Oscvst</a>: a VST3 plugin that
    allows you to send OSC (Open Sound Control) messages from your DAW. It can
    act as a midi keyboard (i.e, trigger a message whenever a note is pressed),
    or as a set of VST parameters (i.e, send a message whenever an automation
    parameter is changed). Oscvst can be used best when controlling a visual
    application, as it allows you to perfectly sync specific events in the DAW
    with the visual output. It was built using the JUCE C++ library

    <a href="https://github.com/hatcatpat/la">la</a>/<a
      href="https://github.com/hatcatpat/ca"
      >ca</a
    >: la (lua audio) and ca (C audio) are two experiments with livecoding audio
    on the audio thread. My desire was to get as close to the raw audio code as
    possible, while still maintaining the “live” aspect of “livecoding”. Lua is
    an interpreted language, and as such it is simple to hot reload the audio
    function. However, C is a compiled language, so it is a lot trickier. The
    solution was to hot reload a dynamic library that contains the audio
    function, whilst making sure that any dynamic memory is stored in a global
    “state” (which is preserved over reloads). Both of these projects included
    various homemade DSP algorithms

  <li>
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CL-GSfsnFlI/">dots spiral</a>: I made
    this audiovisual algorithmic composition for a livestream hosted by Test
    Card (a Manchester-based audiovisual collective), using MaxMSP for the audio
    and OpenFrameworks for the visuals. The audio used 20 randomly generated
    16-step sequencers, each controlling various parameters. I would then send
    OSC messages to control the visual program. The visuals used a particle
    field which would flip between spherical coordinates and noise. Both the
    audio and visuals included a “stutter” effect, which would loop over the
    last second of input

      >Other Sounds xine cover</a
    >: I produced the cover of a local underground music zine (produced by the
    other sounds student group), using a space filling algorithm consisting of a
    bunch of “worms” that collide with each other. When they collide, they can
    return through their path in search of a new route. The algorithm also
    allows you to load images (such as text), and the worms will treat the
    outline of the image as a wall. It was made using p5js

      >pearl with a girl earring</a
    >: This program converts an image into a grid of coloured circles. Each
    circle is controlled by the physics engine (i.e, can collide with other
    circles, and is affected by gravity). These circles are then manipulated
    using physics, producing a similar and yet unexpected outcome. Using the
    same system, I made
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEz-wgknqk8/"
      >the mona with a pearl lisa</a
    >, which drops the circles onto an uneven plane. Both were made with threejs

    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGQEmMMn5EU/">facefall</a>: I have a
    series of pieces using facial recognition and webcam input in
    OpenFrameworks. facefall is my favourite of these, and uses a similar
    approach to pearl with a girl earring: convert the input into physics
    controlled balls. However with this piece, I use OpenCV to detect the
    outline of a person, and then use Monte Carlo to spawn a new ball (whose
    texture is extracted from its spawn position)
