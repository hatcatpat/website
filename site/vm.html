  recently i have been exploring the seemingly mystical world of
  <em>virtual machines</em>
</p>

<h2>uxn</h2>
<p>
  my exploration began when i discovered the <dfn>uxn</dfn> virtual machine +
  language, made by the ingenious and oft eccentric duo of swashbuckling
  techno-sailors known as <dfn>hundred rabbits</dfn>. the <dfn>uxn</dfn> project
  consists of a stack machine with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>256 bytes of working stack, and 256 bytes of return stack</li>
  <li>64kb of ram</li>
  <li>32 opcodes</li>
  <li>16 devices, each with 16 bytes of memory</li>
</ul>

<p>
  on top of this, they have created a <dfn>forth</dfn> style language called
  <dfn>uxntal</dfn>. at its core <dfn>uxntal</dfn>, and in fact all programming
  languages, are simply an elaborate series of <dfn>push/pop</dfn> and
  <dfn>read/write</dfn> calls: i.e, adding/removing things from the stack or
  storing/reading things from memory
</p>

<p>
  finally, they had to create a program to emulate this
  <dfn>virtual machine</dfn>. the approach is the exact same as an emulator for
  any <dfn>physical machine</dfn> (like a game boy, nes, n64, etc). you set up
  all the required data, you connect up all the required <i>devices</i>, and
  just like that bob is quite firmly your uncle. the folks over at
  <dfn>hundred rabbits</dfn> made a perfectly good emulator called
  <dfn>varvara</dfn>
</p>

<p>
  you may well be thinking "isn't it a bit overkill to create an entire virtual
  machine just to make a program/game?", and the answer to that thought is,
  'maybe'. however, the magic of this approach lies in the emulator. okay, so
  lets imagine that you are (hypothetically) using a <i>brand new</i> (or
  <i>brand old</i> i guess) operating system called <i>pat-os</i>, but
  <dfn>varvara</dfn> only works on linux, mac, and windows. you may very well be
  thinking, "great, all my old <dfn>uxn</dfn> programs are useless :(". but fret
  not, my dear, for <dfn>virtual machines</dfn> are magical and wondrous things!
  all you have to do is write a new <i>emulator</i>, not a new program. in fact,
  you don't even have to look at a single line of <dfn>uxntal</dfn>. you just
  have to find a <i>pat-os</i> way of implementing the various stacks, memory
  stores and devices. once you've done that, any and all
  <dfn>uxntal</dfn> programs will work exactly the same as before: provided you
  do it correctly, which i have absolute faith that you will
</p>

<h2>chip8</h2>

<p>
  i may seem cheery now (with the delicious strawberry aftertaste of hindsight),
  but at the time this all seemed to me like an absurdly impossible task. and
  so, i went searching for the oracles of the internet. they told me (through
  various visions and dreams) to gaze upon <em>chip8</em>
</p>

<p>
  <dfn>chip8</dfn> is an 8bit virtual machine and language from the 70's, and it
  was designed for an obscure home computer called the <em>cosmac vip</em>. why
  then, i hear you ask, did the oracles recommend such an archaic system? the
  answer, my dear friends, is that the <dfn>chip8</dfn> is a perfect example of
  what a virtual machine <i>actually</i> is. in fact, the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chip-8">wikipedia</a> page is all you
  need to create a <dfn>chip8</dfn> emulator for yourself!
</p>

<h3>first, the hardware:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>memory</em>: the <dfn>chip8</dfn> has <b>0x1000</b> bytes of memory, and
    traditionally the first <b>0x200</b> bytes contained the interpreter itself.
    this means that our program (and all the 'data' like sprites, fonts, etc)
    must be contained within the range (<b>0x200</b>,<b>0x1000</b>)
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <em>registers</em>: there are <b>16</b> registers (<b>v0</b> to <b>vf</b>),
    however the last register is also used as a flag for some operations. for
    instance, if you change a pixel (from <b>1</b> to <b>0</b>, or from
    <b>0</b> to <b>1</b>), vf will be set to <b>1</b>. there is also an 'address
    register' called <b>i</b>, which is <b>12</b> bits. and finally, a 'program
    counter' called <b>pc</b> which records the current 'line' (in this case,
    the byte) that the program is on
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <em>(return) stack</em>: this stack is used to return from a function (i.e,
    its a stack that only stores addresses to functions), and is large enough to
    go <b>12</b> functions deep
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <em>timers</em>: the <dfn>chip8</dfn> has <b>2</b> 'timers', which are
    numbers that decrease at <b>60hz</b>: one is used as a generic timer, and
    one controls the sound
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <em>input</em>: there are <b>16</b> keys [<b>0</b>,<b>f</b>], each stored as
    single bit
  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <em>video/audio</em>: the screen is <b>64x32</b> <b>1bit</b> color, and you
    draw to it using sprites of width <b>8</b> and height in the range
    [<b>1</b>,<b>16</b>]. the audio is a painful beep, and is enabled whenever
    the sound timer is non-zero
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>now, the software:</h3>
<p>
  okay, now that the hardware is out of the way...how do we program the dang
  thing? well, we use <dfn>opcodes</dfn> of course! everyone loves
  <dfn>opcodes</dfn>. an <dfn>opcode</dfn> is just a number that represents an
  instruction. i.e <dfn>7 = pet dog</dfn>, <dfn>42 = kill jester</dfn>, etc etc.
  the wikipedia entry (is excellent) and lists all of the <b>35</b>
  <dfn>opcodes</dfn>, as well as a c-pseudo code implementation of each. note:
  <dfn>uxntal</dfn> only has 32 <dfn>opcodes</dfn>!
</p>

<p>
  a <i>program</i> then, is simply a list of <dfn>opcodes</dfn>. the following
  describes how to <i>run</i> a program:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    load the program into memory (i.e, by reading a file, or a floppy disk, or a
    vinyl, or a stone tablet, etc)
  </li>
  <li>
    reset the <b>registers</b>, <dfn>pc = 0; i = 0; v0 = 0; ... vf = 0;</dfn>
  </li>
  <li>
    read the first byte of the program. oh look, its <b>0x6034</b>! i love
    <b>0x6034</b>! this is an <dfn>opcode</dfn> which means "set <b>v0</b> to
    the data stored at the <b>0x34</b>-th byte of our program". i.e, the
    <b>6</b> means "set", the <b>0</b> means "<b>v0</b>", and the
    <b>34</b> means "<b>0x34</b>-th byte of our program" (remember, these
    opcodes are all on the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chip-8">wikipedia</a>
    <em>;^)</em> )
  </li>
  <li>
    okay, we did that <dfn>opcode</dfn> really well! lets do the next one: to do
    this, we have to increment <b>pc</b> and then do the <dfn>opcode</dfn> that
    stored in memory at that location
  </li>
  <li>
    then we just repeat this process forever and foreverever and forevereverever
    (well, until we get bored, the program ends, or the heat death of the
    universe)
  </li>
</ul>
