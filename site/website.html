  hi, this is my website. did you find the place okay? here, let me take your
  coat...
</p>
<p>
  this site is generated by a simple c program that automagically inserts the
  commonly used code into every page (i.e, things like the title, menu,
  stylesheet, etc).
</p>
<p>
  it also has some pointlessly cute (and perhaps aggravating) features involving
  randomness: the theme and numbering-style are randomized each time a page is
  generated. the site also has some style choices, such as
</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 colors: fg, bg, and accent</li>
  <li>the first letter of each <dfn>p</dfn> tag is highlighted</li>
  <li>code is denoted by italics and accent-color, $ indicates it is shell command</li>
  <li>inverted colors for <em>emphasis</em></li>
  <li style='text-transform: uppercase'>all lowercase</li>
</ul>
<p>i'm certain new eccentricities will emerge over time <em>:^)</em></p>
<p>
  the program itself is just a series of <dfn>fputs</dfn> commands, with the
  occasional loading of a file. its usage is
  <dfn>$ ./generate page [theme]</dfn> where <i>'page'</i> is the name of the
  page to generate (i.e, in this case its 'website'), and <i>'theme'</i> is
  optional and will select the theme.
</p>
<p>
i used a bash script, <dfn>build.sh</dfn> to <dfn>$ ./generate</dfn> all the files in the
  <i>pages</i> directory. it uses this command (which i wholeheartedly knicked
  from stackoverflow),
<pre>
$ ls ../site/themes | sort -r | tail -$n | while read file; do
  blahblahblahblah
done
</pre>
to output a randomly sorted list of the .css themes. i then take the first one and use that as the theme!
</p>
<em>remark: pipe | and redirection > are neat</em>
