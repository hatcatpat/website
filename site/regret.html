  <i>
    in my flat there is a shower. occasionally, it is on. even more
    occasionally, i am in it. sometimes when these two events coincide, i have a
    thought. this is one of them.
  </i>
</p>

<em>i dont believe in regrets</em>

<p>
  i dont mean that in a sort of hippie way, "just, like, live in the now, man",
  because i have absolutely experienced the <i>feeling</i> of regret. ive felt
  that nausiating grip in my stomach, twisting me out like a wet towel; each
  turn whispering unpleasantries such as "why didnt you do X" and "youre a
  failure, you failed at X, only a failure would fail at X", etc etc etc. it
  teases you with hyper-idealised, perfect and beautiful visions of that oft
  imagined place - the land of <b><i>what could have been</i></b
  >. for what its worth, i hear the grass is rather good over there.
</p>

<p>
  what i do mean, which is arguably the opposite of what i dont mean, is that
  <b>it is impossible to anticipate a regret</b>. regardless of whether you
  believe we are all being tugged along by the long arm of fate, or the long
  integers of the simulation in which we live, or the long hairy dad arm of a
  generic god, or the many colourful arms of a less generic god, or whatever -
  the fact of the matter is that your thoughts and/or feelings are determined by
  your current situation. <b>time is linear, and so are you</b>. this means that
  every decision you make was made in the context of that moment, taking into
  account all the other information and emotions you currently had available to
  you. in my case, often my major decisions were tinted by depression, boredom
  or lonelyness (sometimes, if i was lucky, a bit of all three). so its all very
  well-and-good looking back on your choices, from the nice protective
  time-sphere you find yourself in, and analysing them, optimising them, and
  generally solving them in a more cool-headed way - because the problem has
  changed, current-you is no longer solving the same thing that former-you was.
  essentially current-you has been given one of the infinitude of incorrect
  answers, which statistically makes solving the problem easier.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>youve got to break a few lightbulbs to make an omelette</i></b>
</p>

<p>
  so if you ever feel down and start analysing previous choices with poignent
  phrases like "if i could go back, id do it differently", just remember: if you
  could go back, youd find yourself with the exact same brain, with the exact
  same stimuli, as last time, and would undoubtedly make the same choices again.
</p>

<p>
  enough about the past (i never was one for travelling abroad), lets talk about
  the future. hindsight doesnt help you <i>unfuck</i> a situation, but it can
  lessen the <i>fuck</i> (or increase it, perhaps?) of a new one. your brain is
  chock full of failures. literally to the brim. theres some failure
  <i>oozing</i> out your left nostril, in fact. here, borrow my handkerchief (i
  expect it back, washed). really its the only way we get anything done, its
  herd mentality. instead of fluffy white sheep, its past versions of yourself,
  being brutally picked off by the wolves of disasterous ideas. the very fact
  that you can look back at your previous decisions with new eyes proves that
  this process is working, you are learning. faced with a similar situation, you
  can try out your new solution. maybe it will turn out better this time.
</p>

<p>then again, <em>maybe not</em></p>
