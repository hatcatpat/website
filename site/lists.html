    <em>watched</em>
    <ul>
      <li>
				<dfn>the return of the pink panther [1975]</dfn>: reasonably funny
        slapstick comedy, that maintains a rather loose connection to any sort
        of coherent plot. i also watched the first half of the original "pink
        panther", but stopped due to it being an utter slog, which contains
        unashamed date-rape. the only moments of enjoyment come from the
        inspector (peter sellers) himself, which the creators clearly realised
        as the later films all focus around him. in particular, he gains a
        ludicrously french accent in the later films. its the phonetic
        equivalent of wearing a beret, eating a croissant, drinking coffee and
        smoking a cig on a balcony overlooking the eiffel tower.
      </li>
      <li>
        <dfn>harvie krumpet [2003]</dfn>: horrendously delightful short
        claymation focusing on the unfortunate life of a squishy downtrodden
        polish man, whose head is full of questionable <i>fakts</i> about the
        world. a little bit of crazy goes a long way, and happiness comes from
        within.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <em>read</em>
    <ul>
			<li>
				<dfn>the drowned world, j. g. ballard [1962]</dfn>: a thinky-sci-fi that, albeit in a less precise way, gets at the core
				philosophy of ballard's later books (specifically crash and high rise). it highlights how much of our psychology
				is based on the physical and societal structures around us, and questions what impact a new environment might have.
				its got a good ammount of overly-wanky jargon but the visuals kept me involved. particularly vivid
				were the descriptions of flora and fauna intertwined with the flooded carcases of abandoned buildings, oh and how
				<i>fucking</i> boiling hot it is.
				although the book attributes the rising water levels to solar flares, a modern reader can easily see how
				the current trend of climate change (due to human actions) will create similar situations. what was once a
				hypothetical apocalyptic scenario is now, <i>essentially</i>, inevitable.
			</li>
      <li>
				<dfn>happydale: devils in the desert [1999]</dfn>: a tale about a misguided youth, set in a town
				full of overtly quirky characters. although everyone is weird, none of the characters
				actually stand out. the story itself is fairly mundane, which is made even more apparent by
				the odd backdrop of the town of happydale. the website seems to suggest that they wanted to do
				much more with this small suburban kaleidescope.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
		<em>listened</em>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<dfn>daydream nation, sonic youth [1988]</dfn>: sharp and immensely modern.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

  <div>
    <em>drank / ate</em>
    <ul>
			<li>
				<dfn>jubel, beer cut with peach</dfn>: [beer] tastes like a bad cider, and i dont like cider
			</li>
      <li>
        <dfn>phaedra, pomona island</dfn>: [beer] crisp & fruity, nice can, great album
      </li>
      <li><dfn>schwarzbier, lhg brewpub</dfn>: [beer] light black beer</li>
